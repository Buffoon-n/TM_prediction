In this paper, we addressed the traffic matrix prediction problem in backbone networks where the future traffic is estimated under the lack of precise historical data. We exploited the Convolutional LSTM network for extracting and modeling the spatiotemporal feature of the traffic matrices. We proposed a novel deep learning model and techniques which leverage the forward and backward ConvLSTM networks to correct input data and determine flows monitored at the next timestep. We conducted extensive experiments for evaluating our proposed approach. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms other well-known methods for time series analysis.
